      "intro1": "For me, art is quite a broad concept. Probably because I'm young and I can absorb it all - different materials, colours and technologies. However, I tend to lean more towards newer art methods, the most exciting of which is 3D. For me, this form of visual expression offers the most freedom and surprising results.",
      "intro2": "I have a rather 'weird' approach to generating ideas - new and exciting ideas that pop into my head and stay there for quite a long time before they start to form into something more concrete. I don't draw or write anything anywhere, but I think intensely and finally decide that now is the time to get something done. This can happen spontaneously or by forcing myself. The work is usually slow, I like to let it settle for a couple of months or more and then come back again.",
      "intro3": "I find ideas in different places but the main source is still the internet. That's where there's the most information and where cultures, subcultures and countercultures evolve rapidly. I'm most into visually stricking themes and architecture but I'm also interested in different cultures. Lately, I have started to look more closely at different political and geopolitical issues, the human psyche, mental disorders and how this gives rise to different subcultures and/or countercultures.",

I wanted to envision a future space scenario where humanity, due to climate change, has migrated to the mesosphere, living on gigantic floating sculptural objects. The capsules within these objects serve as individual living quarters, inspired by shapes from nature. In addition to the capsules, there is also a communal area where everyone gets to socialize. My design process involved extensive research, drawing inspiration from various sources including architectural marvels in Asia, science fiction literature, and film classics from the 60’s to the modern age big blockbuster spectacles.",

And yet it managed to keep me on the edge of my seat for the full runtime. It’s also got some interesting back-and-forth between the black-and-white and color shots—one from Strauss’s POV and the other from Oppenheimer’s, respectively.

Combat is incredibly fun and varied. A kickass soundtrack. The narrative uses the worldbuilding exceptionally well, and it’s not just a story about punks fighting the system or a gun-for-hire climbing the criminal underworld ladder. Cyberpunk 2077’s main quest is far more philosophical, drawing heavily from existentialism and posthumanism. At its core, it’s a story about identity, weaving that theme through every part of the game. The length of the main quest is also pretty spot on. It’s sharp and to the point — all killer, no filler. The quests have some decision-making that ripples outward, though less so than The Witcher 3, but the production value is also higher. The characters are excellent. - 9/10" },
        "witcher3": { "title": "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - 2015/2016", "desc": " - This game showed everyone (and Bethesda) that vast open-world games can have an abundance of complex stories and well-written characters. The combat is by far the weakest link, but it’s by no means bad, and eventually becomes fun. Both main and side quests offer a decent amount of decision-making, with consequences that appear later down the line. Gwent was so good that CDPR ended up making a separate game just for it. The soundtrack is just lovely. - 8/10" },
